        <h1 id="page-title">Methodology</h1>
        <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;">We evaluated companies' commitment towards sustainability using three metrics: annual emissions, intensity, and trend. Then, we sorted companies into six groups based on their performance levels in these metrics.</p>

        <h3>Emissions, intensity, and trend</h3>
        <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;"><strong>Total Emissions (metric tons CO2):</strong> Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy (Scope 2). All other indirect emissions (Scope 3) were not included in our analysis because Scope 3 emissions vary widely and are more difficult to classify, report, and account. For example, the emissions data of consulting firms does not include air travel. Due to restrictions from the CDP, we could not release the raw emissions data.</p>
        <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;"><strong>Intensity (metric tons CO2 produced / $ billlion spent):</strong> The amount of carbon emissions per each good and service provided. We calculated intensity by dividing total emissions by refined operating costs. Refined operating costs are directly related to the company's day-to-day maintenance, such as research and development, administrative needs, and production costs. Other costs, such as investments in other goods and industries, were not included. This data was taken from publicly available company annual reports.</p>
        <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;"><strong>Emissions intensity trend (metric tons CO2 produced / $ billlion spent / yr):</strong> The slope of the line of best fit of the company's intensity for the past ten years. A positive trend indicates increasing intensity, while a negative trend indicates decreasing intensity (decreasing is what we want to see!!!).</p>

        <h3>Which Companies Are in the Dataset</h3>
        <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;">Only companies with public emissions and financial data are included in the dataset. Emissions data was provided from the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), a third-party organization that companies report their emissions to. If we could not access company data from the CDP, we retrieved emissions data from the company sustainability report. Financial data was retrieved from company annual reports.</p>
        <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;">Our dataset not only includes companies registered for this year’s Career Fair, but also a selection of companies from past Career Fairs. This is because we wanted our dataset to be representative of companies that would normally appear at Fall Career Fair, despite the Covid-19 disruption this year.</p>
        <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;">To view the list of companies registered for the Career Fair excluded from our dataset, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rlOS_6i9O1DbjK-oQxgbEOlcxyV3Ma0W0vNJXmEad6A/edit?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration-line: none;">click here</a>. These companies lack transparency in emissions data, financial data, both emissions and financial data, or are excused. Excused companies include smaller firms (&lt;100 employees) and start-ups (founded 2015 or earlier).</p><br>

            <h3>Grouping Companies Based on Total Emissions and Intensities</h3>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;">We ran a k-means clustering algorithm to sort the companies into different groups based on performance in log(emissions) and log(intensity). We used a log factor because the range of values was too large to create effective groups, due to a few outliers. See Fig 1 for the average emissions and intensities in each cluster before the log operation.</p>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;">For total emissions, the optimal number of groups was seven. However, to be consistent with the optimal number of groups for intensity, we combined groups seven (which only had two companies) and six for total emissions.</p><br>

            <h1>How to Look at and Examine the data</h1>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;">The company snapshot gives you a high-level summary of the company total emissions and intensity rankings (Fig 1) and whether the company has been increasing or decreasing its intensity over the past ten years (Fig 2).</p>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;">The lower the ranking, the lower total emissions or intensity. For example, in <strong>Figure 1</strong>, Accenture is in Group 3 for annual emissions. As a company with 25K+ employees, we expect their total emissions to be relatively high. To normalize our analysis by company size, we look at intensity. Because Accenture is in Group 2 for intensity, it produces relatively fewer emissions per dollar spent compared to other companies. Note that our calculations don’t include Scope 3 emissions, which would involve air travel.</p>
            <div style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;"><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows if the change in a company’s intensity has increased or decreased in the last ten years. For example, on average, Exxon’s emission intensity has increased. However, this does not tell the whole story. Students can also explore the data for intensity.</div><br><br>

            <h3>Diving into Intensity</h3>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;">The next slide in Tableau shows intensity and trend data. The raw data for emissions couldn’t be shown in accordance with regulations from the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), a third party organization that companies can report their emissions data to.</p>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;"><strong>Figure 3</strong> shows the intensity data. Observe how Exxon’s intensity in the past four years has actually decreased, although its intensity in 2019 was still higher than in 2014. What happened in 2016? Does Exxon plan to continue decreasing its intensity? These are questions students can ask at the Career Fair!</p>
            <p style="list-style-type: disc; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; line-height: 1.38;"><strong>Figure 4</strong> shows the value of the trend. Blue values are negative, while orange values are positive. Keep in mind that although the intensity normalizes the emissions by a company’s size, it can be much easier for a company that started off with a high intensity (inefficient, many metric tons CO2 / $) to decrease its intensity vs. a company that already started off with a low intensity (efficient, few metric tons CO2 $). In other words, the marginal cost of decreasing intensity increases. Take this into account when looking at the trend values, and remember to ask companies questions!</p><br>
