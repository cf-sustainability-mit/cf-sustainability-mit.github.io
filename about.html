              <h2>Why this project?</h2>
              <p style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:14px;">The MIT Career Fair is a significant event each fall where students are introduced to hundreds of companies/organizations across a multitude of sectors: biotech and healthcare, finance, consulting, information technology, robotics, energy and utilities, transportation, defense, government, social, manufacturing… Increasingly, MIT students are becoming aware of all sectors’ responsibilities in reducing global emissions and creating environmental solutions. Students want to know that the business that they will be working for is having a positive impact. The MIT Fall Career Fair Sustainability Initiative helps students recognize their potential employers’ commitments towards their environmental responsibilities, and the progress they are making toward meeting those commitments.</p><br>

                <div id="context">
                  <h2>Context: the climate crisis and the role of companies</h2>
                  <p>The news cycle is non-stop with stories of increased frequency and intensity of wildfires, floods, extreme heat, hurricanes. Nineteen of the 20 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001.</p>
                  <p>The increase in climate-related disasters is alarming and is in large part due to human activity since the start of the industrial revolution. We homo sapiens are responsible for rising carbon and greenhouse gas emissions that have led to this climate crisis.</p>
                  <p>Companies are responding. In a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-109/Accenture-UNGC-CEO-Study.pdf#zoom=40">comprehensive study</a> on businesses’ contribution to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a> (also known as SDGs), 99% of CEOs from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenues believe sustainability will be important to the future success of their business, and business leaders are embracing market opportunities to drive growth.</p>
                  <p>As Sheila Kennedy-Moore (MIT '21 MechE graduate) mentions in <a target="_blank" href="./assets/Kennedy-Moore-sheilakm-sb-meche-2021-thesis.pdf">her thesis on Student Perspectives regarding Company Sustainability</a>, companies must be held responsible for not only their direct emissions, but also their indirect emissions, which include scope 3 emissions.</p>
                  <p>The second graph to the right shows how industry fits into global emissions. The graph makes it clear that industrial emissions make up a majority of the emissions we are so desparately trying to reduce. We can also glean a better idea of the specific aspects of industry—like the use of iron, steel, and chemicals— that make up the largest percentages.</p><br>

                <div id="rationale" style="float: left;">
                  <h2>Our Rationale</h2>
                  <p>Other evidence of companies’ changing actions is in the growth of sustainable investing using sustainability ratings data called Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, ratings. According to research by MIT Professor Roberto Rigobon, an estimated $30 trillion in assets worldwide use ESG ratings to make investing decisions. However, in his paper<a target="_blank" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3438533"> Aggregate Confusion: The Divergence of ESG Ratings</a>, he showed that divergence in sustainability ratings is high and examined what drives these differences.</p>
                  <p>This paper, published in 2019, influenced our decision-making around how to infuse sustainability at the MIT Fall Career Fair. <strong>We decided to not rely on ratings of companies, but rather present publicly available raw data (carbon emissions and financials) and our own direct investigations, in an effort to present a fuller and more accurate picture.</strong></p><br><br>

            <h1>How to Use This Website</h1>
            <p>Focus on what you should ask employers.</p>
            <p>There is no single, tidy metric that tells the full story for any given company, but we aim to provide information that will help students form their own opinions. We are providing some data to you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:14px;">Answers to questions companies were asked during the registration process</li>
              <li style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:14px;">Links to companies’ reports that they provided to us</li>
              <li style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:14px;">Analyses of companies’ recent annual carbon emissions, their intensity and the trend in their intensity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe this website to be a useful starting point. <strong>If you are interested in learning more, contact us! (email below)</strong></p>
          </div>

          <div id="limitation" style= "width:100%; float: left">
            <h1 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;">Limitations and Intent</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>We are not arbitrators or judges. We have striven to present the facts.</li>
              <li>With respect to carbon emissions analyses, people have made careers of life cycle analysis (LCA) and sustainability measurements. We do not claim to have this experience and we do not claim that our analyses are the be all and end all. We are new at this.</li>
              <li>Any process is biased. So is a carbon analysis. Example: if you started focusing on emissions in 2011, your trend in emissions probably looks good for you. If you just started recently, it most likely does not (this is one bias in our methodology). Example #2: your company might be one of the strongest in the country in pushing for public policy that ensures that carbon is “priced,” either through a carbon tax, cap and trade, etc. Currently this will not show up in our data analysis, even though it is critical.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, we decided to move forward on all fronts – with a lot of humility – because we want to start the conversation. Our hope is that students will be equipped with more resources to make an informed decision and recruiters are better prepared to answer questions from students that they have not heard before. We aim to continually improve and update the analyses each year.</p>
            <p style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:14px;">We hope to be back at the Career Fair next year. We are eager for suggestions.</p>
